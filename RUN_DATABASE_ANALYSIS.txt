🔍 DATABASE ANALYSIS COMMANDS

First, let's understand the current database structure without making any changes.

SSH to server:
ssh -i "C:\Users\Admin\awsconection.pem" ubuntu@13.48.248.180

Then run these commands to analyze the database:

1. Check database structure:
sudo mysql -u root -p inventory_db < understand-database-structure.sql

2. Test login and permissions via API:
node analyze-database-on-server.js

3. Check auth middleware function:
grep -n "getUserPermissions" middleware/auth.js

4. Check if server is running:
ps aux | grep "node server.js"

5. Check server logs for permission queries:
tail -20 server.log

EXPECTED FINDINGS:
- Admin user exists but may have 0 permissions
- CMS user exists but may have 0 permissions  
- Test user exists and should have some permissions
- role_permissions table may be empty or incomplete
- Auth middleware may not be returning permissions correctly

This will help us understand WHY permissions are showing as 0 without breaking anything.
