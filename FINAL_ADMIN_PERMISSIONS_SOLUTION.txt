FINAL ADMIN PERMISSIONS SOLUTION
================================

The issue has been identified and partially fixed:

✅ FIXED: Database permissions
- Admin user exists with email: admin@company.com
- Admin role (role_id=1) now has 28 permissions assigned
- Database is working correctly

❌ REMAINING ISSUE: Server not starting
- Node.js server fails due to missing notification controller module
- This prevents the login API from working

MANUAL SOLUTION (Run these commands on your server):

1. SSH into your server:
   ssh -i "C:\Users\Admin\awsconection.pem" ubuntu@56.228.29.188

2. Go to project directory:
   cd ~/inventoryfullstack

3. Create a simple notification controller:
   echo "class NotificationController {
     static triggerUserLoginNotification() { return true; }
     static triggerUserLogoutNotification() { return true; }
   }
   module.exports = NotificationController;" > controllers/notificationController.js

4. Start the server:
   nohup node server.js > server.log 2>&1 &

5. Test the login API:
   curl -X POST https://56.228.29.188.nip.io/api/auth/login \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"email":"admin@company.com","password":"password"}' -k

EXPECTED RESULT:
You should see a JSON response with:
- "success": true
- "permissions": [array of 28 permission names]

LOGIN CREDENTIALS:
- Email: admin@company.com  
- Password: password
- URL: https://56.228.29.188.nip.io

Once the server starts successfully, your frontend will show all 28 permissions for the admin user instead of zero permissions.

The core issue was that the admin role was missing permissions in the database, which has now been fixed.
