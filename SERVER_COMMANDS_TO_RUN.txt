COMMANDS TO RUN ON SERVER
========================

1. SSH to your server:
   ssh your-username@16.171.197.86

2. Access MySQL as root:
   sudo mysql

3. Run the reset script:
   source /path/to/RESET_PERMISSIONS_SYSTEM_CLEAN.sql

   OR copy-paste the SQL commands from RESET_PERMISSIONS_SYSTEM_CLEAN.sql

4. Exit MySQL:
   exit

5. Restart your Node.js server:
   pm2 restart all
   
   OR if using different process manager:
   sudo systemctl restart your-app-name

WHAT THIS DOES:
===============
- Removes ALL users except admin@company.com
- Creates clean 5 roles: super_admin, admin, manager, staff, viewer
- Creates 17 essential permissions only
- Sets up proper role-permission relationships
- Admin user becomes super_admin with all permissions
- Clean database ready for testing

AFTER RUNNING:
==============
- Login as admin@company.com with password: admin@123
- Test that Products tab shows (admin has products.view)
- Create new users and assign different roles
- Test that permissions work correctly
- When you update a user's role, they should see changes on refresh
